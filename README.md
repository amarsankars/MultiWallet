## Getting started

This app is based on [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

* **Note: requires a node version >= 6 and an npm version >= 3.**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ivanminutillo/Sankara your-project-name
$ yarn
$ npm run dev
```
*In order to work, at this stage you need to run on your terminal ```sbot server``` or having another ssb app already running.*

## Features

The app actually is just a POC, it implements the basic features in order to manage a mutual currencies wallet:

- See all your transactions history
- Join a new currency
- See your balance in each currency you joined
- See how many people use a currency
- Send / receive transactions

## Open Questions
- Can a user send a private Tx to another member?
- How one or more users define the rules of a currency?

## Roadmap
TODO
